Thanks to student Adham Zahran (Ain Shams University, FCIS, 3rd year) for solving a serious problem with boot Makefrag that prevented the course from running correclty with modern GCC.

His effort along with the work of FOS TAs team lead to the migration of the FOS course and development tools to modern Linux and Windows (through Cygwin)
